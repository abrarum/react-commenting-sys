# Reddit-like commenting module

The project deploys a simple in-depth commenting system like Reddit. The tech-stack includes **React** with strict **Typescript**. No external libraries are used. For minimal styling, I have make use of **material design UI** api. The module uses **depth first search** algorithm to iterate over the index. There's a lot of room for improvement and we can discuss it in detail.
